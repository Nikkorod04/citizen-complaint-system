# Tanod Emergency Response Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Tested

---

## Overview

- priority (enum: high, urgent)
- status (enum: submitted, assigned, in_progress, on_the_way, resolved, cancelled)
- tanod_id (foreign key → users.id, nullable)
- tanod_response (text, nullable)

```

### 2. `urgent_request_updates` Table (8 columns)
```sql

## Workflow Overview

### Emergency Request Lifecycle

```
CITIZEN:
1. Citizen logs in → Goes to dashboard
2. Clicks "Submit Urgent Request"
3. Fills form (title, description, location, category, priority)
4. Submits request → Status: "submitted"
5. Can view request in "My Urgent Requests"
6. Tracks real-time status updates from tanod
7. Can cancel if not yet assigned/responded

TANOD:
1. Tanod logs in → Redirected to /tanod/dashboard
2. Sees "Pending Requests" stat card (yellow)
3. Views pending requests list
4. Clicks "Accept & Assign to Me"
5. Request auto-assigned to tanod → Status: "assigned"
6. Views full details & requester info
7. Responds with status:
   - "In Progress" (started response)
   - "On The Way" (en route to location)
   - "Resolved" (completed/resolved)
8. Can add optional message & location coordinates
9. Views all their active & resolved requests

TRACKING:
- Each status update creates UrgentRequestUpdate record
- Citizen sees timeline of all updates
- Timestamps tracked for submit → assign → respond → resolve
- Historical view of resolved requests
```

## Notes & Best Practices

1. **Verified Citizen Requirement:** Tanods also require `verified.citizen` middleware to access routes
2. **Status Workflow:** Only tanods can update status; citizens can only cancel
3. **Geolocation:** Optional latitude/longitude can be stored with each update
4. **Audit Trail:** All status updates are logged in `urgent_request_updates` table
5. **Color Coding:** Status colors follow consistent design system across app
6. **Pagination:** All list views support pagination (10-15 items per page)
7. **Conditional UI:** Buttons and forms only show when appropriate for current status

---

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- ⭐ Citizen ratings/feedback for tanod response
- 📅 Scheduled emergency drills & training tracking
