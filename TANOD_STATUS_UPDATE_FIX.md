# Fix: Unable to Edit Status After First Update

## Problem
After marking a request as "on_the_way", the "Respond to Request" form disappeared, preventing the tanod from updating the status further (e.g., to mark it as "resolved").

## Root Cause
The form visibility was controlled by checking if `responded_at` is null:

```blade
@if (!$urgentRequest->responded_at)
    <!-- Show form -->
@endif
```

This meant the form only appeared **once**. After the first status update, `responded_at` was set and the form disappeared for subsequent updates.

## Solution
Changed the form visibility condition to check if the request is **not resolved** instead:

```blade
@if ($urgentRequest->status !== 'resolved')
    <!-- Show form -->
@endif
```

Now the form remains visible throughout the entire workflow until the request reaches "resolved" status.

## Changes Made

**File:** `resources/views/tanod/show.blade.php`

**Line 90:** Changed visibility condition from:
```blade
@if (!$urgentRequest->responded_at)
```

To:
```blade
@if ($urgentRequest->status !== 'resolved')
```

## Updated Workflow

Now you can update status multiple times in sequence:

```
1. Accept & Assign
   Status: assigned
   Form: ✅ VISIBLE

2. Click "Update Status" → Select "In Progress"
   Status: in_progress
   Form: ✅ VISIBLE (before fix: ❌ HIDDEN)

3. Click "Update Status" → Select "On The Way"
   Status: on_the_way
   Form: ✅ VISIBLE (before fix: ❌ HIDDEN)

4. Click "Update Status" → Select "Resolved"
   Status: resolved
   Form: ❌ HIDDEN (request complete)
```

## Response History Section

When the request is resolved, instead of the form, you'll see the "Response History" section showing all status updates made:

```
Response History
├─ In Progress (2:34 PM)
├─ On The Way (2:45 PM)
└─ Resolved (3:00 PM)
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Accept a request** (Status: assigned)
   - ✅ Form visible with "Update Status" button

2. **Click "Update Status"** → Select "In Progress" → Submit
   - ✅ Status changes to "in_progress"
   - ✅ Form still visible (KEY FIX!)
   - ✅ Response History shows update

3. **Click "Update Status" again** → Select "On The Way" → Submit
   - ✅ Status changes to "on_the_way"
   - ✅ Form still visible
   - ✅ Response History shows both updates

4. **Click "Update Status" again** → Select "Resolved" → Submit
   - ✅ Status changes to "resolved"
   - ✅ Form disappears (request complete)
   - ✅ Response History shows all three updates

- `app/Http/Controllers/TanodController.php` - `updateStatus()` method (creates entries in `urgent_request_updates` table for audit trail)
- `app/Models/UrgentRequestUpdate.php` - Stores each status update with timestamp
- `resources/views/tanod/show.blade.php` - Display request details and update form

## Database Schema

### urgent_requests table
```
status: enum('submitted', 'assigned', 'in_progress', 'on_the_way', 'resolved', 'cancelled')
responded_at: timestamp (set on first update)
resolved_at: timestamp (set when status = 'resolved')
```

### urgent_request_updates table
```
urgent_request_id: foreign key
tanod_id: foreign key (who made the update)
status: string (in_progress, on_the_way, resolved)
message: string (optional tanod response)
created_at: timestamp
```

Each status update creates a new entry in `urgent_request_updates`, creating a full audit trail of all changes.

## Comparison: Before vs After

| Action | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Accept request | Form shows | Form shows ✅ |
| Update to "in_progress" | Form hides | Form shows ✅ |
| Update to "on_the_way" | N/A (couldn't) | Form shows ✅ |
| Update to "resolved" | N/A (couldn't) | Form shows, then hides ✅ |

## Future Enhancements

1. Add ability to re-open a resolved request (if needed)
2. Add comment/note field for each status update
3. Add photo upload capability for evidence
4. Add GPS tracking to log location at each status change
5. Send SMS/push notifications to citizen at each status change
