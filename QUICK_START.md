## 🎨 Creating Views

All views should extend the Breeze layout (`<x-app-layout>`) and use Tailwind CSS classes.

### Example View Template:
```blade
<x-app-layout>
    <x-slot name="header">
        <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 leading-tight">
            {{ __('Page Title') }}
        </h2>
    </x-slot>

    <div class="py-12">
        <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
            <div class="bg-white overflow-hidden shadow-sm sm:rounded-lg">
                <div class="p-6 text-gray-900">
                    <!-- Your content here -->
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</x-app-layout>
```

## 💡 Key Features Working

1. **Role-Based Dashboards**: Each role automatically redirects to their dashboard
2. **QR Code Generation**: Auto-generated when secretary approves citizen
3. **File Uploads**: Photos/videos stored in `storage/app/public/`
4. **Notifications**: Database notifications ready (display in views needed)
5. **PDF Export**: Controller method ready, just needs PDF view template

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**QR Codes not showing?**
- Make sure storage link is created: `php artisan storage:link`

**Can't upload files?**
- Check storage permissions
- Verify `storage/app/public` exists

**Database errors?**
- Run: `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`

**Views not found?**
- Make sure you're creating files in `resources/views/` directory
- Check route names match controller returns

## 📝 Next Development Steps

1. **Create all view files** (list above)
2. **Style with Tailwind CSS** (already included)
3. **Add notification bell** in navigation
4. **Implement search/filters** in complaint lists
5. **Add email notifications** (optional)
6. **Create activity logs** for transparency

## 🎯 Pro Tips

- Use `@foreach` to loop through complaints/users
- Use `@can` directive for permission checks
- Flash messages available via `session('success')` or `session('error')`
- Media files accessible via `$complaint->getMedia('evidence')`
- Status badges: pending (yellow), validated (blue), resolved (green), rejected (red)
